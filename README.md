# Astro Github Time Element

This is a astro wrapper for the [@github/time-elements](https://github.com/github/time-elements) library, it does a few things:

- Makes importing components is easier
- Ability to use `Date` objects with the `datetime` prop
- Adds typing to props
- `<LocalTime>`: creates it own date object by default
- Small API for adding attributes
- Classes use the `class:list` directive
